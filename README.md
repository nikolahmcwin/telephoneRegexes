# telephoneRegexes
This small program was me playing around with regexes and learning some of their power. This was an assignment for a paper that I was not enrolled in, but chose to undertake because it was not something I had looked at before. Created Jan 2018. I also hadn't coded in Java for over 8 months.

TelephoneApp.java read input from stdin in the format of a telephone number, per one line. It will determine if the number is in a correctly allowed format i.e. VALID and output this to screen in the correct output format. 

Criteria for valid and invalid input or output can be found in the etude outline Telephone.pdf
